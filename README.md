# LLVM Binary Builds

This repo has builds of binaries of LLVM for various platforms, which are then pushed to a release.

Of course, in theory I could edit those releases myself. For security reasons, I'd suggest just forking the
repo and running it yourself. Maybe in the future some sort of auto-generated checksum system would be good?

Platforms:

- Windows x86_64
- Linux x86_64
- MacOS x86_64
- MacOS ARM (M1)
- WebAssembly
